## Mandatory Requirements:

* You must create a website that allows you to upload an image and insert text on it, styled appropriately.

 **In other words, a meme generator.** ðŸ˜œ

### 1 - The website must have a text box with which the user can interact to insert text on top of the chosen image.

- You must create an element to serve as _ "container" _ for the **image** and **text** of the meme;
- Within the container element, you must create another element to show the typed text;
- If there is no image inserted, it must be inserted and visible within the empty container where the image will appear.

### 2 - The website should allow users to upload an image from their computer.

- Within the container element, you must create another element to show the selected image;
- The image must be completely contained within the element identified as `meme-image-container`;
- The text inserted in the element `text-input` must be inserted over the chosen image` meme-image`.

### 3 - The website must have a frame in the container. The frame must be 1 pixel wide, black and solid. The area where the image will appear must have a white background.

- The element that serves as a container for the image must have a white background color;
- The element that serves as a container for the image must have a solid black border, 1 pixel wide;

### 4 - The text that will be inserted on the image must have a specific color, shadow and size.

- The text of the `meme-text` element must have a black shadow, 5 pixels horizontally, 5 pixels vertically and a blur radius of 5 pixels;
- The text of the element `meme-text` must have the font with the size of 30 pixels;
- The text of the element `meme-text` must be in white color;

### 5 - Limit the size of the text that the user can enter to 60

## Bonus:

### 6 - Allow users to customize the chosen meme by adding one of the three borders. The page must have three buttons, which when clicked must each change their own border around the container.

- tag `button`;

   * A button identified with the `id` called `fire` must style the image container with a 3-pixel, _dashed_ and red border.
   * A button with `id` called `water` should style the image container with a blue border, with 5 pixels of the _double_ type.
   * A button with `id` called `earth` must style the image container with a border of the _groove_ type, green and with 6 pixels.

- After one of the three borders is selected, the standard border specified in requirement 3 should no longer appear;

### 7 - Have a set of four pre-made images of famous memes for the user to choose from. Show thumbnails of the images and, upon user's click, this image must appear inside the frame of the container element.

- The images must appear inside the container in a similar way to the images sent by _upload_ to the page.
