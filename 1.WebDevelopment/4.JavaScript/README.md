# Welcome to the Playground Functions Project repository!

## Mandatory Requirements:

### 1 - Using the operator &&

Create a function called `compareTrue` that, when receiving two booleans
- Return `true` if both values are true;
- Return `false` if one or both parameters are false.

### 2 - Triangle area

Write a function named `calcArea` that receives a base value (called` base`) and a height value (called `height`) of a triangle and returns the calculation of its area.

Remember that the area of a triangle is calculated using the following formula: (base * height) / 2.

### 3 - Dividing the sentence

Write a function with the name `splitSentence`, which will receive a string and return an array of strings separated by each space in the original string.

Example: if the function receives the string `"go Trybe"`, the return should be `['go', 'Trybe']`.

### 4 - String concatenation

Write a function with the name `concatName` that, upon receiving an array of strings, returns a string with the format `'LAST ITEM, FIRST ITEM'`, regardless of the size of the array.

Example: if the parameter passed to `concatName` is Array ['Lucas', 'Cassiano', 'Ferraz', 'Paolillo'], the function should return` Paolillo, Lucas`.

### 5 - Points in football

Write a function with the name `footballPoints` that receives the number of wins (this parameter should be called `wins`) and the number of ties (this parameter should be called `ties`) and return the number of points that the team scored in a championship.

Therefore, consider that each victory is worth 3 points and each draw is worth 1 point.

### 6 - Repetition of the largest number

Write a function called `highestCount` that, upon receiving an array of numbers, returns the number of times the largest of them is repeated.

Example: if the parameter of `highestCount` is an array with values `[9, 1, 2, 3, 9, 5, 7]`, the function should return `2`, which is the number of times that the number `9` (highest number of the array) is repeated.

### 7 - Mouse Hunt

Imagine that there are two cats, which we will call `cat1` and` cat2`, and that both are after a mouse called `mouse`. Imagine that each of the three animals is in a position represented by a number.

Knowing this, create a function called `catAndMouse` that, upon receiving the position of` mouse`, `cat1` and` cat2`, **in that order**, calculate the distances between the mouse and the cats and return which of the felines will reach the mouse first (the one that will be closest).

Example: if the cat `cat2` is 2 units away from the mouse, and` cat1` is 3 units away, its function should return `'cat2'`.

If the cats are at the same distance from the mouse, the function should return the string `"cats bump and the mouse runs away"`.

### 8 - FizzBuzz

Create a function called `fizzBuzz` that receives an array of numbers and returns an array as follows:

- For each Array number that is divisible by only 3, present a string `"fizz "`;
- For each Array number that is divisible by only 5, present a string `"buzz"`;
- If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, return the string `"fizzBuzz"`;
- If the number cannot be divided by 3 or 5, return the string `"bug!"`;

Example: if the parameter is [2, 15, 7, 9, 45], your function should return `["bug!","FizzBuzz","bug!","Fizz","fizzBuzz"]`.

### 9 - Encode and Decode

Create two functions: the first should be called `encode` and, when receiving a string as a parameter, you should replace all lowercase vowels with numbers, according to the following format:

a -> 1 \
e -> 2 \
i -> 3 \
o -> 4 \
u -> 5

That is, if the `encode` parameter is `"hi there!"`, The return should be `"h3 th2r2!"`.

The second function should be called `decode` and does the opposite of `encode` - that is, it receives a string containing numbers instead of lowercase letters and will return a string with lowercase vowels instead of numbers (so, if the parameter of `decode` is `"h3 th2r2!"`, the return should be `"hi there!"`).

### 10 - List of technologies

Create a function that receives an array of technology names that you want to learn. This function must also receive a second parameter called `name` with a name.

For each technology in the array, create an object with the following structure:

``
{
   tech: "NomeTech",
   name: name
}
``

These objects must be inserted in a new list in ascending order from the `tech` field in the object.
The output of your function should be a list of objects ordered by the `tech` field of the objects with the format above.

Example:
``
Function inputs:

["React", "Jest", "HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript"]
"Lucas"

// Output:
[
   {
     tech: "CSS",
     name: "Lucas"
   },
   {
     tech: "HTML",
     name: "Lucas"
   },
   {
     tech: "JavaScript",
     name: "Lucas"
   },
   {
     tech: "Jest",
     name: "Lucas"
   },
   {
     tech: "React",
     name: "Lucas"
   }
]
``

If the array comes empty, its function should return 'Empty!'

### Bonus

### 11 - Phone number

Create a function called `generatePhoneNumber` that receives an array with 11 numbers and returns a phone number, respecting parentheses, dashes and spaces.

Example: if the function parameter is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 1], `generatePhoneNumber` should return `(12) 34567-8901`.

- If the function receives an array with a size other than 11, it should return `"Array with incorrect size."`.

- If any of the numbers in the array is less than 0, greater than 9 or is repeated 3 times or more, `generatePhoneNumber` must return the string `"it is not possible to generate a phone number with these values"`.

### 12 - Condition of existence of a triangle

A triangle consists of three lines: `lineA`,` lineB` and `lineC`. Create a function called `triangleCheck` that should take the three lines as a parameter and return if it is possible to form a triangle with the values presented for each line

To do so, keep in mind a few considerations:

- For it to be possible to form a triangle, it is necessary that the measurement of either side is less than the sum of the measurements of the other two and greater than the absolute value of the difference between these measurements.
- To obtain the absolute value of a number in JavaScript, search for the `Math.abs` function.
- The return of your function must be a Boolean.

Example: the return of `triangleCheck (10, 14, 8)` should be `true`.

### 13 - Welcome to the Trybe Bar!

According to the rules of this bar, each drink should drink a glass of water so that there is no hangover.

Create the function `hydrate` that receives a string, and return the suggestion of how many glasses of water you should drink. 
Examples:
``
String received:
   "1 beer"
Returned string:
   "1 glass of water"
``

``
String received:
   "1 cachaÃ§a, 5 beers and 1 glass of wine"
Returned string:
   "7 glasses of water"
``

``
String received:
   "1 cachaÃ§a, 5 beers and 1 glass of wine"
Returned string:
   "7 glasses of water"
``
