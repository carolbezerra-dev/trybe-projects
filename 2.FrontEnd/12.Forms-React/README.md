# Welcome to the Movie Cards Library Stateful project repository!

---

You should develop an application that consists of a dynamic movie card library using React, composed of:

* A header;

* A search bar, used to filter which cards will be displayed in the card list;

* A list of cards, where each card represents a film and has an image, title, subtitle, synopsis and evaluation;

* A form to add a new card to the library.

A possible implementation of this library is shown below.

## Project requirements

#### Create a component called `SearchBar`

This component will render a bar with filters above the card listing.  

#### Render a form inside `SearchBar`

#### Render a text input inside the form in `SearchBar`

#### Render a checkbox input inside the form in `SearchBar`

#### Render a select inside the form in `SearchBar`

#### Create a component called `AddMovie`

This component will render a form that allows you to add a new movie card to the library

#### Configure the initial state of the `AddMovie` component

#### Render a form inside `AddMovie`

Within this form there will be fields used to fill in information for the new card to be added to the library.

#### Render a text input inside the form in `AddMovie` to get the title of the new movie

#### Render a text input inside the form in `AddMovie` to get the subtitle of the new movie

#### Render a text input inside the form in `AddMovie` to get the path of the new movie image

#### Render a `textarea` inside the form in` AddMovie` to obtain the synopsis of the new film

#### Render an `number` input inside the form in` AddMovie` to get the evaluation of the new film

#### Render a `select` of the form in` AddMovie` to select the genre of the new film

#### Render a form button in `AddMovie` to make use of the data from the new movie, contained in the state of` AddMovie`

#### Create a component called `MovieLibrary`

This component will render the movie library which will render `searchBar` and` addMovies` to filter by movies and add a movie to the library respectively.

#### Configure the initial state of the `MovieLibray` component

#### Render `SearchBar` inside` MovieLibrary`

#### Render `MovieList` inside` MovieLibrary`

#### Render `AddMovie` inside` MovieLibrary`
